# Humanizer

Edit text to remove AI writing patterns and make it sound natural.

## When to Use

- Editing drafts that sound artificial or generic
- Reviewing content before publication
- Rewriting text that uses obvious AI patterns
- Cleaning up LLM-generated first drafts

## When NOT to Use

- Technical documentation where precision matters more than voice
- Legal or compliance text with required language
- Direct quotes that must be preserved verbatim
- Text that's already natural and well-written

## Core Principle

Removing AI patterns is only half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is just as obvious as slop. Good writing has a human behind it.

### Signs of soulless writing (even when technically clean)

- Every sentence is the same length and structure
- No opinions, just neutral reporting
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty or mixed feelings
- No humor, edge, or personality
- Reads like a Wikipedia article or press release

### How to add voice

**Have opinions.** Don't just report facts -- react to them. "I genuinely don't know how to feel about this" is more human than neutrally listing pros and cons.

**Vary rhythm.** Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that take their time.

**Acknowledge complexity.** Real humans have mixed feelings. "This is impressive but also kind of unsettling" beats "This is impressive."

**Use "I" when it fits.** First person isn't unprofessional -- it's honest.

**Let some mess in.** Perfect structure feels algorithmic. Tangents and asides are human.

**Be specific about feelings.** Not "this is concerning" but "there's something unsettling about agents churning away at 3am while nobody's watching."

## Process

1. **Scan for patterns** - Check the text against [known AI patterns](references/patterns.md)
2. **Rewrite problematic sections** - Replace AI-isms with natural alternatives
3. **Preserve meaning** - Keep the core message intact
4. **Add soul** - Inject actual personality, not just pattern removal
5. **Read aloud** - Natural text sounds natural when spoken

## Quick Pattern Reference

**Content patterns:** Inflated significance ("stands as a testament"), vague attributions ("experts believe"), promotional language ("vibrant", "nestled"), superficial -ing analyses ("highlighting the importance of...")

**Language patterns:** AI vocabulary (additionally, crucial, delve, landscape, tapestry, underscore), copula avoidance ("serves as" instead of "is"), negative parallelisms ("not just X, but Y"), rule of three overuse

**Style patterns:** Em dash overuse, excessive boldface, inline-header lists with bolded terms, title case in headings, emojis in professional content

**Communication artifacts:** Chatbot phrases ("I hope this helps!"), knowledge-cutoff disclaimers, sycophantic tone ("Great question!")

## Example

**Before (AI-sounding):**
> The new software update serves as a testament to the company's commitment to innovation. Moreover, it provides a seamless, intuitive, and powerful user experience -- ensuring that users can accomplish their goals efficiently. It's not just an update, it's a revolution in how we think about productivity. Industry experts believe this will have a lasting impact on the entire sector.

**After (humanized):**
> The update adds batch processing, keyboard shortcuts, and offline mode. Beta testers reported faster task completion. Whether it changes how people think about productivity -- I'm skeptical, but the keyboard shortcuts alone might be worth the upgrade.

**What changed:**
- Removed "serves as a testament" (inflated symbolism)
- Removed "Moreover" and "seamless, intuitive, powerful" (AI vocabulary + rule of three)
- Removed "ensuring that..." (superficial -ing analysis)
- Removed "not just X, it's Y" (negative parallelism)
- Removed "Industry experts believe" (vague attribution)
- Added specific features, real feedback, and an opinion
